This repository demonstrates a potential error in Haskell code involving the safe handling of list heads and function application. The `bug.hs` file contains code that shows how using `safeHead` with a function like `factorial` can lead to unexpected behavior if exception handling isn't explicitly implemented. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.
